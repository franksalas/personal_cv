	\begin{cvletter}
		
		\lettersection{About Me}
		Having trouble finding someone with health care experience, a deep understanding of machine learning models and doesn't get confused with a confusion matrix?\\
		I believe that my experience as a data analyst at Texas Children's Hospital and familiarity analyzing public unstructured data make me the perfect match for this role.
			
		\lettersection{Why Me?}
		As a candidate, here’s what I could immediately bring to the table:
		
		\textbf{An effective NLP analyst}: In my role as a student, one of my capstone projects involved text classification on public health care business reviews. I was able to showcase my expertise in Natural Language Processing by converting a corpus of documents into a matrix of token word counts, extracted features by applying term frequency-inverse document frequency and compare predicted labels by applying Naive Bayes Classifiers along with Support Vector Machine.
		
		\textbf{A disciplined leader}: I have always displayed my careful approach to leadership by taking the initiative in most projects. At Texas Children's Hospital, I had the opportunity to suggest and create laboratory software training videos for onboarding staff,  reducing new employee training time by six weeks, which further shows my dedication on improving patient care.
		
		\textbf{A passionate staff member}: Everything I have engaged in so far has all been driven by my keen interest in patient care. Even as a laboratory technician, I made sure to dedicate some part of my day to find ways of reducing the response time of STAT testing results. It is this passion that has driven every one of my career decisions thus far.
		
		\lettersection{Why MD Anderson?}
		I would be overjoyed to be a part of an institution whose mission is to eliminate cancer by providing programs that integrate patient care and prevention.  To be involved in research and say that my daily actions at work improve lives not just in Texas but across the globe. 
		I look forward to contributing my skills and experiences at MD Anderson and hope to have the opportunity to speak with you further about how I can be an asset to your team.
